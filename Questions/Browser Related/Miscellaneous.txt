ðŸ”¹ Browser Internals & Rendering
    Walk me through what happens in the browser when you type a URL and hit enter.
    Explain the difference between the DOM, CSSOM, and Render Tree.
    What are critical rendering paths and how can you optimize them?
    How do browsers handle reflows and repaints? Give examples of code that might trigger each.
    Whatâ€™s the difference between a composite layer and the main thread in rendering?

ðŸ”¹ Networking & Critical Flows
    Whatâ€™s the role of DNS resolution, TCP handshake, and TLS negotiation in a page load?
    How do HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 affect browser request flows?
    How does the browser decide when to open a new connection vs. reuse an existing one?
    Explain the concept of preload, prefetch, and prerender in resource loading.
    Why might the order of script tags impact page performance?

ðŸ”¹ JavaScript & Execution
    How does the JavaScript event loop work in a browser?
    Whatâ€™s the difference between macrotasks and microtasks?
    How does the browser handle asynchronous rendering when JavaScript execution blocks the UI?
    What are Web Workers and how do they interact with the DOM?
    How does the browser optimize garbage collection in JS engines like V8?

ðŸ”¹ Security in Browsers
    Explain Same-Origin Policy (SOP) and why itâ€™s important.
    What are CORS preflight requests and when are they triggered?
    How do XSS and CSRF attacks exploit browser behavior?
    Whatâ€™s the difference between sessionStorage, localStorage, cookies, and IndexedDB in terms of security?
    Why do browsers use sandboxing for tabs and iframes?

ðŸ”¹ Performance & Optimization
    How would you reduce the Time to Interactive (TTI) of a web app?
    How do browsers handle lazy loading of images and scripts?
    What is a Critical Rendering Path waterfall (e.g., in Chrome DevTools) and how do you interpret it?
    What are long tasks, and how would you debug them in a browser?
    How does the browser cache work (memory cache, disk cache, service worker cache)?

ðŸ”¹ Debugging & Tools
    How would you diagnose layout thrashing using Chrome DevTools?
    Whatâ€™s the difference between Performance tab vs. Network tab in DevTools profiling?
    How would you debug a memory leak in a web app?
    How can you simulate network throttling and CPU slowdown in the browser?
    Whatâ€™s the role of Lighthouse in web performance auditing?

ðŸ”¹ System Design & Browser Architecture
    How do modern browsers achieve process isolation for tabs?
    Why do browsers use multi-process architecture instead of a single process?
    How does the browser scheduler prioritize rendering vs. scripting vs. user input?
    Whatâ€™s the role of a GPU process in rendering pipelines?
    If you had to design a lightweight browser, what trade-offs would you consider?
