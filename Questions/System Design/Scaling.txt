Additional Questions:

Q: How do you identify performance bottlenecks in a React app?

A:
- React DevTools Profiler: Identify slow components and renders
- Browser DevTools: Performance tab, Lighthouse audits
- Bundle analysis: webpack-bundle-analyzer, source-map-explorer
- Memory leaks: React DevTools, Chrome DevTools Memory tab
- Network analysis: Check API response times and payload sizes
- Real User Monitoring: Track actual user performance metrics

Q: How does React's reconciliation algorithm affect performance?

A:
- Virtual DOM diffing: Compares virtual DOM trees to minimize real DOM updates
- Diffing algorithm: O(n) complexity, uses heuristics for efficiency
- Key prop: Helps React identify which items changed, moved, or were added
- Reconciliation strategies: Batching updates, skipping unchanged subtrees
- Performance impact: Can be slow with large lists or complex components
- Optimization: Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders

Q: How do you optimize a React app for mobile devices?

A:
- Code splitting: Reduce initial bundle size
- Image optimization: Use WebP, lazy loading, responsive images
- Touch interactions: Optimize for touch events and gestures
- Memory management: Avoid memory leaks, optimize for limited RAM
- Network optimization: Minimize API calls, use caching
- Performance budgets: Set limits for bundle size and performance metrics

Q: How do you implement micro-frontends in React?

A:
- Module Federation: Share components between applications
- Single-spa: Framework-agnostic micro-frontend framework
- Webpack Module Federation: Built-in support for micro-frontends
- Communication: Use custom events, shared state, or APIs
- Deployment: Independent deployment of each micro-frontend
- Routing: Handle routing between different micro-frontends

Q: What's the difference between SSR and SSG in React?

A:
- SSR (Server-Side Rendering): Renders on server for each request
- SSG (Static Site Generation): Pre-renders at build time
- SSR: Better for dynamic content, SEO, slower initial load
- SSG: Faster loading, better performance, limited to static content
- Use cases: SSR for user-specific content, SSG for marketing pages
- Tools: Next.js supports both SSR and SSG

Q: How do you handle state management in a large React application?

A:
- Redux: Centralized state management with predictable updates
- Context API: Built-in React state management for smaller apps
- Zustand: Lightweight state management library
- State colocation: Keep state close to where it's used
- State normalization: Structure state to avoid duplication
- DevTools: Use Redux DevTools for debugging and time-travel

Q: What are the best practices for code splitting in React?

A:
- Route-based splitting: Split by routes using React.lazy()
- Component-based splitting: Split large components
- Dynamic imports: Use import() for conditional loading
- Bundle analysis: Use webpack-bundle-analyzer to identify opportunities
- Preloading: Use webpackPrefetch for critical chunks
- Error boundaries: Handle loading errors gracefully

Q: How do you ensure immutability in React state updates?

A:
- Object spread: {...state, newProperty: value}
- Array methods: [...array, newItem] or array.filter()
- Nested updates: {...state, user: {...state.user, name: newName}}
- Immer library: Write mutable code, get immutable updates
- Structural sharing: Only change what's necessary
- Avoid: Direct mutations, push(), splice(), direct property assignment

Q: What's the difference between functional and class components in terms of FP principles?

A:
- Functional: Pure functions, easier to test, more predictable
- Class: Object-oriented, lifecycle methods, this binding
- Functional: Better for functional programming principles
- Class: More familiar to OOP developers
- Hooks: Functional components can use state and lifecycle
- Performance: Functional components with hooks are generally faster

Q: How do you implement currying in React components?

A:
- Higher-order components: Functions that return components
- Custom hooks: Encapsulate logic and return functions
- Function composition: Combine multiple functions
- Partial application: Pre-fill some arguments
- Example: const withAuth = (Component) => (props) => <Component {...props} auth={auth} />
- Benefits: Reusability, composition, separation of concerns

Q: What are the benefits of using pure functions in React?

A:
- Predictability: Same input always produces same output
- Testability: Easy to test without mocking
- Performance: Can be memoized with React.memo
- Debugging: Easier to debug and reason about
- Reusability: Can be used in different contexts
- Side effects: No unexpected side effects

Q: How do you handle side effects in functional programming with React?

A:
- useEffect: Handle side effects in functional components
- Custom hooks: Encapsulate side effect logic
- Pure functions: Keep components pure, move side effects to hooks
- Event handlers: Handle user interactions
- Async operations: Use async/await or promises
- Cleanup: Return cleanup functions from useEffect
