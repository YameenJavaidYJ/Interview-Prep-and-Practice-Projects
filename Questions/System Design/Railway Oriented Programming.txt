Railway-Oriented Programming (ROP) offers benefits such as improved code readability and clarity by explicitly 
showing success and failure paths, enhanced robustness through consistent, type-safe error handling that avoids 
unexpected exceptions, better modularity and testability as each functional step is an isolated, composable unit, 
and simplified maintenance as new steps can be easily added to the "railway" chain
