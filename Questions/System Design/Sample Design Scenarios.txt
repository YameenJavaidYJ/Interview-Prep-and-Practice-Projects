1. Design a URL Shortener (like Bitly)
    How would you generate unique short URLs?
    How would you handle collisions?
    What database schema would you use?
    How would you make it scale to millions of requests per second?

2. Design a Rate Limiter
    How would you prevent abuse (e.g., a user sending 1000 requests per second)?
    Which algorithms could you use? (token bucket, leaky bucket, sliding window, fixed window)
    Could you use Redis for this?
    How do you handle rate limiting in a distributed setup (multiple servers)?

3. Design a Chat Application (like WhatsApp Web or Slack)
    How do you support real-time messaging (WebSockets, SSE, polling)?
    How do you ensure message delivery if a user is offline?
    How do you store chat history?
    How do you scale to millions of concurrent connections?

4. Design an Authentication + Session Management System
    Whatâ€™s the difference between sessions and JWTs?
    How do you handle user sessions in a load-balanced environment?
    How do you secure tokens (refresh tokens, CSRF protection)?
    How do you support SSO (Google login, etc.)?

5. Design a File Upload Service (like Google Drive or S3)
    How do you handle large file uploads (chunking, resumable uploads)?
    How do you store files (object storage vs relational DB)?
    How do you serve files back efficiently (CDN)?
    How would you scale for millions of users?

6. Design a Notification System (Email, SMS, Push)
    How do you handle retries if a notification fails?
    How do you queue messages (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams)?
    How do you make sure notifications are not duplicated?
    How do you support scheduling (send tomorrow at 9AM)?
