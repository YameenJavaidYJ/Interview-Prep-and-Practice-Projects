Sharding and Indexing

What are indexes in databases and how do they work?

Indexes = data structures (often B-trees or Hashes) that improve query speed by allowing faster lookups.
Example: Index on email lets DB find user quickly instead of scanning entire table.
Tradeoff: Faster reads, slower writes (because index must update).
ðŸ‘‰ Useful for search-heavy tables.

How do transactions work in databases?

A transaction = a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit.

Follow ACID properties:

    Atomicity â†’ all or nothing.
    Consistency â†’ database remains valid.
    Isolation â†’ concurrent transactions donâ€™t interfere.
    Durability â†’ once committed, changes survive crashes.
    ðŸ‘‰ Example: Bank transfer = debit + credit must both succeed or rollback.
