1. Vacuuming SQL

Answer:

SQL Vacuuming is a database maintenance operation that reclaims storage space and optimizes database performance by:

-   Removing dead tuples (deleted/updated rows that are no longer visible)
-   Updating table statistics for the query planner
-   Compacting the database to reduce file size
-   Freeing up space for reuse

Types:

-   VACUUM - Reclaims space but doesn't lock the table
-   VACUUM FULL - Reclaims more space but locks the table
-   VACUUM ANALYZE - Updates statistics for better query planning

When to use:

-   After heavy DELETE/UPDATE operations
-   When database size grows unexpectedly
-   Before performance-critical queries
-   Regular maintenance schedules

Additional Questions:

Q: What's the difference between VACUUM and VACUUM FULL in PostgreSQL?

A: 
- VACUUM: Non-blocking, reclaims space but doesn't lock table, can run concurrently with other operations
- VACUUM FULL: Blocking operation, locks table, reclaims more space by rewriting entire table, requires exclusive lock
- Use VACUUM for regular maintenance, VACUUM FULL only when significant space needs to be reclaimed

Q: How does vacuuming affect database performance during execution?

A:
- VACUUM: Minimal impact, runs in background, may slightly increase I/O
- VACUUM FULL: High impact, blocks all operations on table, can cause downtime
- Performance impact depends on table size and system load
- Schedule during low-traffic periods for VACUUM FULL

Q: When would you schedule automatic vacuuming vs manual vacuuming?

A:
- Automatic: Default PostgreSQL behavior, runs based on table activity and dead tuple count
- Manual: When you need immediate cleanup, after bulk operations, or when autovacuum is disabled
- Configure autovacuum parameters (vacuum_cost_delay, vacuum_cost_limit) based on system requirements

Q: How does vacuuming relate to MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)?

A:
- MVCC creates dead tuples when rows are updated/deleted (old versions remain until vacuumed)
- Vacuuming removes these dead tuples to reclaim space
- Without vacuuming, dead tuples accumulate causing table bloat and performance degradation
- Vacuuming also updates visibility map and free space map for MVCC efficiency
