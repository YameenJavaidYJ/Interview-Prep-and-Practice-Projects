16. Use cases and benefits of DB caching and replication or snapshots if they are same

Answer:

Database Caching:

Use Cases:
- Frequently accessed data that doesn't change often
- Expensive query results
- Session data and user preferences
- API response caching
- Static content caching

Benefits:
- Faster data access (memory vs disk)
- Reduced database load
- Improved application performance
- Lower latency for end users
- Cost-effective scaling

Database Replication:

Use Cases:
- Read scaling (multiple read replicas)
- Disaster recovery and backup
- Geographic distribution
- Load distribution
- High availability

Benefits:
- Improved read performance
- Data redundancy and fault tolerance
- Geographic data distribution
- Load balancing
- Disaster recovery

Database Snapshots:

Use Cases:
- Point-in-time backups
- Data migration and testing
- Compliance and auditing
- Development and staging environments
- Data analysis without affecting production

Benefits:
- Consistent data state at specific time
- Fast backup creation
- Safe testing environment
- Compliance requirements
- Data recovery options

Key Differences:

Caching vs Replication:
- Caching: Temporary, can be lost, faster access
- Replication: Permanent, persistent, slightly slower

Replication vs Snapshots:
- Replication: Continuous, real-time, multiple copies
- Snapshots: Point-in-time, static, single copy

When to Use Each:

Caching:
- When you need fast access to frequently used data
- When data can be regenerated if lost
- For session data and temporary information

Replication:
- When you need high availability
- For read scaling
- For disaster recovery

Snapshots:
- For backups and compliance
- For testing and development
- For data migration

Additional Questions:

Q: What are the challenges of database sharding?

A:
- Data distribution strategy (range-based, hash-based, directory-based)
- Cross-shard queries and transactions (distributed transactions)
- Data rebalancing when adding/removing shards
- Maintaining referential integrity across shards
- Query routing and load balancing
- Monitoring and debugging across multiple shards

Q: What's the CAP theorem and how does it affect database scaling decisions?

A:
- Consistency: All nodes see same data simultaneously
- Availability: System remains operational
- Partition Tolerance: System continues despite network failures
- Can only guarantee 2 out of 3 properties
- Affects choice between CP systems (MongoDB) vs AP systems (Cassandra)
- Influences replication strategy and consistency models

Q: How do you handle cache invalidation in a distributed system?

A:
- Write-through: Update cache and database simultaneously
- Write-behind: Update cache first, database later
- TTL-based: Cache expires after time period
- Event-driven: Invalidate based on data change events
- Version-based: Use version numbers to detect stale data
- Cache-aside: Application manages cache, invalidates on updates

Q: What's the difference between master-slave and master-master replication?

A:
- Master-Slave: One master for writes, multiple slaves for reads, unidirectional
- Master-Master: Multiple masters for both reads/writes, bidirectional
- Master-Slave: Simpler, no write conflicts, eventual consistency
- Master-Master: Higher availability, write conflicts possible, complex conflict resolution

Q: How do you ensure data consistency across multiple database replicas?

A:
- Synchronous replication: Wait for all replicas to confirm before commit
- Asynchronous replication: Commit locally, replicate in background
- Quorum-based: Require majority of replicas to agree
- Conflict resolution strategies: Last-write-wins, vector clocks, CRDTs
- Eventual consistency: Accept temporary inconsistency for better performance

Q: When would you use database snapshots vs traditional backups?

A:
- Snapshots: Point-in-time consistency, faster creation, space-efficient
- Traditional backups: Full data copy, slower creation, more storage
- Use snapshots for: Development/testing, quick recovery, compliance
- Use backups for: Long-term storage, disaster recovery, migration

Q: How do you implement read replicas for scaling database reads?

A:
- Configure master to replicate to multiple read replicas
- Route read queries to replicas, writes to master
- Handle replication lag (eventual consistency)
- Load balance read requests across replicas
- Monitor replica health and failover if needed
- Consider geographic distribution for global applications

Q: What are the challenges of database replication in a microservices architecture?

A:
- Each service may have different replication needs
- Cross-service data consistency becomes complex
- Network partitioning affects multiple services
- Service discovery and routing for replicated databases
- Monitoring replication health across services
- Handling partial failures and cascading issues

Additional Questions:

Q: What's the difference between read replicas and sharding?

A:
- Read Replicas: Multiple copies of same data, all reads go to replicas, writes to master
- Sharding: Data split across different databases/servers, each shard has different data
- Read Replicas: Better for read scaling, data consistency, simpler setup
- Sharding: Better for write scaling, data distribution, more complex queries

Q: How do you handle data consistency in a distributed database?

A:
- ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- CAP theorem: Choose 2 out of 3 (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance)
- Eventual consistency: Accept temporary inconsistency for better performance
- Strong consistency: All nodes see same data simultaneously (performance cost)
- Use appropriate consistency model based on business requirements

Q: How would you implement database failover?

A:
- Master-slave setup with automatic failover
- Health checks and monitoring
- Load balancer configuration for failover
- Data replication to standby servers
- Application-level failover logic
- Testing failover procedures regularly

Additional Questions:

Q: What are the trade-offs between different caching strategies (Redis vs Memcached)?

A:
- Redis: Rich data types, persistence, clustering, more memory usage
- Memcached: Simple key-value, higher performance, less memory usage
- Redis: Better for complex data structures, pub/sub, transactions
- Memcached: Better for simple caching, higher throughput
- Use Redis: When you need persistence, complex data types, clustering
- Use Memcached: When you need maximum performance for simple caching
