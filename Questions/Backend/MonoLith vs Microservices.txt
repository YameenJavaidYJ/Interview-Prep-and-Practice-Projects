4. What are microservices and how do they differ from monolithic architectures?

    Monolith â†’ all features in one big codebase, tightly coupled, harder to scale independently.
    Microservices â†’ application split into small, independent services (e.g., user service, payment service). Each has its own DB & API.
    ðŸ‘‰ Pros: scalability, deploy independently. Cons: more complexity (network, monitoring, coordination).
