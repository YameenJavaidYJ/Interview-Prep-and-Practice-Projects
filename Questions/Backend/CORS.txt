What is CORS and how do you handle it?

    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) â†’ browser security policy that restricts requests from different origins.

    Handled by setting response headers on server:

    Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers
    ðŸ‘‰ In Express: use the cors middleware.
