2. Difference between SQL and NoSQL databases

SQL: Relational, structured schema, ACID compliance, good for complex queries. (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

    NoSQL: Non-relational, flexible schema, horizontally scalable, BASE (eventually consistent). (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)
    Use SQL for transactions, NoSQL for scalability/unstructured data.

Additional Questions:

Q: What are the performance implications of PostgreSQL's MVCC vs MySQL's locking?

A:
- PostgreSQL MVCC: Readers never block writers, better concurrency, more storage overhead
- MySQL locking: Readers can block writers, simpler implementation, less storage overhead
- MVCC: Better for read-heavy workloads, higher storage usage due to versioning
- Locking: Better for write-heavy workloads, potential for lock contention

Q: How does JSONB in PostgreSQL compare to MySQL's JSON implementation?

A:
- PostgreSQL JSONB: Binary storage, indexed, supports operators, better performance
- MySQL JSON: Text storage, functional indexes, limited operators, slower queries
- JSONB: Better for complex queries, faster updates, more storage efficient
- MySQL JSON: Simpler implementation, better for simple storage/retrieval

Q: What are the replication differences between the two databases?

A:
- PostgreSQL: Streaming replication, logical replication, WAL-based
- MySQL: Binary log replication, statement/row/mixed formats
- PostgreSQL: More flexible replication options, better consistency
- MySQL: Simpler setup, more mature tooling, better performance

Q: How do you handle full-text search in PostgreSQL vs MySQL?

A:
- PostgreSQL: Built-in full-text search, GIN/GiST indexes, ranking, stemming
- MySQL: Full-text indexes, MATCH/AGAINST syntax, limited features
- PostgreSQL: More powerful, better performance, more features
- MySQL: Simpler to use, good for basic search needs

Q: What are the licensing differences and their implications?

A:
- PostgreSQL: Open source (PostgreSQL License), no restrictions
- MySQL: Dual licensing (GPL + Commercial), requires commercial license for proprietary use
- PostgreSQL: No licensing costs, complete freedom
- MySQL: Potential licensing costs, more restrictive for commercial use
