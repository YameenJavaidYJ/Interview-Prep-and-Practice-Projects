What are RESTful APIs and how do they work?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for APIs.

RESTful APIs use HTTP methods:

    -> GET → read
    -> POST → create
    -> PUT/PATCH → update
    -> DELETE → remove

They are stateless, meaning each request contains all necessary info (no session stored on server).
    Example: /users/1 returns user with id=1.
