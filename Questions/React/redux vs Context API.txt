REDUX vs CONTEXT API - WHEN TO USE WHICH
==================================================

OVERVIEW
---------
    -> Redux: Predictable state container for JavaScript apps
    -> Context API: React's built-in state management solution
    -> Both solve the prop drilling problem but have different use cases

-----------------------

REDUX
=====

WHEN TO USE REDUX
-----------------
    -> Large applications with complex state logic
    -> Multiple components need access to the same state
    -> State updates are frequent and complex
    -> Need time-travel debugging
    -> Team development with predictable state patterns
    -> Need middleware for async operations (Redux Thunk, Saga)

PROS
----
    -> Predictable state updates (pure functions)
    -> Excellent debugging tools (Redux DevTools)
    -> Time-travel debugging
    -> Middleware support for async operations
    -> Strict unidirectional data flow
    -> Great for large applications
    -> Hot reloading support
    -> Extensive ecosystem

CONS
----
    -> Boilerplate code (actions, reducers, store)
    -> Learning curve
    -> Overkill for simple applications
    -> Additional dependencies



CONTEXT API
===========

WHEN TO USE CONTEXT API
-----------------------
    -> Small to medium applications
    -> Simple state sharing between components
    -> Theme switching, authentication state
    -> Avoiding prop drilling for a few values
    -> Built-in React solution preferred
    -> Minimal boilerplate required

PROS
----
    -> Built into React (no additional dependencies)
    -> Simple to implement
    -> Less boilerplate code
    -> Perfect for theme, auth, language switching
    -> Easy to understand and maintain
    -> Good for component-scoped state

CONS
----
    -> Can cause unnecessary re-renders
    -> No time-travel debugging
    -> Limited debugging tools
    -> Not suitable for frequent updates
    -> Can become complex with multiple contexts
    -> Performance issues with large state objects



DECISION MATRIX
===============

USE REDUX WHEN:
--------------
    -> Application has complex state logic
    -> Multiple components need the same state
    -> State changes are frequent and complex
    -> Need predictable state updates
    -> Require time-travel debugging
    -> Working with a large team
    -> Need middleware for async operations
    -> Building a large-scale application

USE CONTEXT API WHEN:
--------------------
    -> Simple state sharing needs
    -> Small to medium applications
    -> Theme, authentication, or language state
    -> Want to avoid prop drilling
    -> Prefer built-in React solutions
    -> Minimal boilerplate preferred
    -> State updates are infrequent

-----------------------

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
=========================

REDUX PERFORMANCE:
-----------------
    -> Uses shallow equality checks
    -> Only re-renders components that use changed state
    -> Optimized with React-Redux selectors
    -> Better for frequent state updates

CONTEXT API PERFORMANCE:
-----------------------
    -> All consumers re-render when context value changes
    -> Can cause performance issues with large objects
    -> Use multiple contexts to minimize re-renders
    -> Consider useMemo and useCallback for optimization

OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
-----------------
    -> Context API: Split contexts by update frequency
    -> Context API: Use React.memo for components
    -> Redux: Use reselect for expensive computations
    -> Redux: Normalize state shape for better performance

-----------------------

HYBRID APPROACH
===============

COMBINING BOTH:
--------------
    -> Use Redux for global application state
    -> Use Context API for component-tree-specific state
    -> Theme/UI state → Context API
    -> Business logic state → Redux
    -> Authentication → Context API or Redux (depending on complexity)

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
-----------------
    -> Redux: User data, shopping cart, API cache
    -> Context API: Theme, language, UI preferences
    -> Local State: Form inputs, component-specific UI state

-----------------------

CONCLUSION
==========

SIMPLE RULE OF THUMB:
--------------------
    -> Start with Context API for simple needs
    -> Migrate to Redux when complexity grows
    -> Use Redux from the beginning for complex applications
    -> Consider the team's experience and project requirements

FINAL DECISION FACTORS:
----------------------
    -> Team expertise
    -> Application complexity
    -> Performance requirements
    -> Debugging needs
    -> Long-term maintainability
    -> Development timeline
