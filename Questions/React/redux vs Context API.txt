REDUX vs CONTEXT API - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE
--------

OVERVIEW
--------
    - Redux: Predictable state container for JavaScript apps
    - Context API: React's built-in state management solution  
    - Both solve prop drilling but serve different purposes

QUICK COMPARISON

REDUX                                    CONTEXT API
------                                    -----------
✅ Middleware support                    ❌ No middleware
✅ Decentralized state management        ❌ Centralized state
✅ Unidirectional data flow              ❌ Bidirectional flow
✅ Time-travel debugging                 ❌ No debugging tools
✅ State persistence                     ❌ Manual implementation
✅ Performance optimization              ❌ Re-render issues
✅ Complex state logic                   ❌ Simple state only

--------

WHEN TO USE WHICH
--------

-> USE CONTEXT API FOR:
    - Simple, infrequent state changes
    - Authentication state, theme preferences
    - Component trees with <10-15 consumers
    - State that updates rarely (few times per session)

-> USE REDUX FOR:
    - Complex state logic with multiple interactions
    - Frequent state updates
    - Cross-component communication
    - State persistence requirements
    - Performance-critical applications
    - Large-scale applications

--------

CONTEXT API LIMITATIONS
--------

-> 1. PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS
    - Every consumer re-renders when ANY part of context changes
    - No selective subscriptions like Redux selectors
    - Manual optimization required

-> 2. COMPLEX STATE LOGIC
    - E-commerce cart: discounts, inventory, shipping, taxes
    - Context becomes unwieldy with complex calculations
    - Redux slices handle this better

-> 3. CROSS-COMPONENT COMMUNICATION
    - Chat app: messages, notifications, typing indicators
    - Context struggles with multiple interdependent updates
    - Redux actions coordinate better

-> 4. STATE PERSISTENCE & DEBUGGING
    - Form wizard with 10 steps - user loses progress on refresh
    - Context: Manual localStorage implementation
    - Redux: Built-in persistence with redux-persist

--------

REDUX ADVANTAGES
--------

-> MIDDLEWARE PIPELINE
Action → Middleware 1 → Middleware 2 → Reducer → State Update

Common Middleware:
    - Redux Thunk: Async actions
    - Redux Logger: Action/state logging  
    - Redux Persist: State persistence
    - Redux DevTools: Time-travel debugging

--------

STATE ARCHITECTURE
--------

-> CENTRALIZED (Redux):
┌─────────────┐
│ Redux Store │ ← Single source of truth
└─────────────┘
     ↕️ ↕️ ↕️
 Comp1 Comp2 Comp3

-> DECENTRALIZED (Component State):
Comp1(state) ← → Comp2(state) ← → Comp3(state)

--------

DATA FLOW
--------

-> UNIDIRECTIONAL (Redux):
UI Event → Action → Reducer → New State → UI Update
   ↑                                           ↓
   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

-> BIDIRECTIONAL (Context):
Components can directly modify context values

--------

IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES
--------

-> CONTEXT API IMPLEMENTATION:
    - See: Codes/context Api code.tsx
    - Theme provider with toggle functionality
    - Custom hook for context consumption

-> REDUX IMPLEMENTATION:
    - See: Codes/redux code.tsx  
    - Counter and name changer with Redux store
    - Action creators, reducers, and selectors

--------

DECISION MATRIX
--------

-> Choose Context API if:
    □ Simple state management
    □ Few components consuming state
    □ Infrequent updates
    □ No persistence needs
    □ Small to medium apps

-> Choose Redux if:
    □ Complex state logic
    □ Many components consuming state
    □ Frequent updates
    □ State persistence required
    □ Large-scale applications
    □ Performance optimization needed
    □ Debugging tools required
