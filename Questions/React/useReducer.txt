Complex dataStructure of State

abstracting the state update logic


Complex State Logic: When your state transitions involve multiple sub-values or complex interactions between different 
parts of the state, useReducer provides a more structured and predictable way to manage these changes compared to numerous 
useState calls.

Centralized State Management: useReducer centralizes all state-modifying logic within a single reducer function, making 
it easier to understand, debug, and maintain the state of your component. This promotes cleaner code and better separation of concerns.
