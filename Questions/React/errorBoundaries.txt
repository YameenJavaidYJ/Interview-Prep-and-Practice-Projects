ERROR BOUNDARIES - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE
--------

WHAT ARE ERROR BOUNDARIES?
--------

React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree,
log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire app.

-> KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
    - Only work with class components (no functional equivalent yet)
    - Catch errors during rendering, lifecycle methods, and constructors
    - Cannot catch errors in event handlers, async code, or SSR

--------

MODERN IMPLEMENTATION (2024)
--------

-> IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:
    1. Traditional Class Component Error Boundary
    2. React Error Boundary Library (recommended)
    3. Custom Error Boundary with advanced features

-> LIBRARY RECOMMENDATION:
    - Use react-error-boundary package over custom implementations
    - Provides hooks and components for modern React patterns
    - Better TypeScript support and testing utilities

-> MONITORING INTEGRATION:
    - Sentry: Real-time error tracking
    - LogRocket: Session replay + error tracking  
    - Bugsnag: Error monitoring with context
    - Rollbar: Error aggregation and analysis

--------

WHAT ERROR BOUNDARIES DON'T CATCH
--------

❌ Event handlers (onClick, onSubmit, etc.)
❌ Async code (setTimeout, promises, async/await)
❌ Server-side rendering errors
❌ Errors in the error boundary itself
❌ Errors during event bubbling

--------

BEST PRACTICES (2024)
--------

-> 1. STRATEGIC PLACEMENT:
    - Route-level boundaries for page sections
    - Feature-level boundaries for specific features
    - Third-party component boundaries
    - Don't wrap every component - be strategic

-> 2. MULTIPLE LEVELS:
    - Implement boundaries at different component levels
    - Allow graceful degradation
    - Prevent single point of failure

-> 3. RICH ERROR REPORTING:
    - Include user context and app state
    - Add error categorization
    - Include stack traces and component hierarchy

-> 4. USER-FRIENDLY FALLBACKS:
    - Provide meaningful error messages
    - Include recovery options (retry, refresh)
    - Maintain app functionality where possible

-> 5. TESTING:
    - Write tests for error boundary behavior
    - Test both error catching and fallback rendering
    - Include integration tests

--------

COMMON USE CASES
--------

-> ROUTE-LEVEL BOUNDARIES:
    - Catch errors in entire page sections
    - Prevent entire app crashes
    - Provide page-level error recovery

-> FEATURE BOUNDARIES:
    - Isolate failures in specific features
    - Allow other features to continue working
    - Provide feature-specific error handling

-> THIRD-PARTY COMPONENT BOUNDARIES:
    - Wrap external libraries
    - Prevent third-party errors from crashing app
    - Provide fallback for missing components

-> FORM BOUNDARIES:
    - Handle validation and submission errors
    - Prevent form crashes from breaking UX
    - Provide form-specific error recovery

-> API INTEGRATION BOUNDARIES:
    - Handle network and data errors
    - Provide offline/error states
    - Allow graceful API failure handling

--------

REACT 19+ INTEGRATION
--------

-> SUSPENSE INTEGRATION:
    - Error boundaries work better with Suspense
    - Improved error handling for async components
    - Better integration with concurrent features

-> FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Potential functional component error boundaries
    - Better integration with React Server Components
    - Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
