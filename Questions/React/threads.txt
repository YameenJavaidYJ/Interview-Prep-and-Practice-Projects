JavaScript Threading - Interview Guide
--------

-> Core Question
Q: Does JavaScript have threads?

-> Answer
JavaScript is single-threaded but uses:

    -> Web Workers (Browser)
        - True parallelism for CPU-intensive tasks
        - Run in separate threads
        - Communicate via message passing
        - Cannot access DOM directly

    -> Worker Threads (Node.js)
        - Similar concept to Web Workers
        - Handle CPU-intensive operations
        - Prevent blocking the main thread

    -> Event Loop
        - Handles async operations without blocking
        - Single-threaded but non-blocking
        - Uses callbacks, promises, and async/await

--------

-> Key Points
    - Main thread: Single-threaded execution
    - Background threads: Web APIs, Workers
    - Non-blocking: Event loop prevents blocking
    - Concurrency: Achieved through async patterns, not multi-threading
