useState vs useRef

* When to use useState, when useRef? 
* How does useRef help avoid re‐rendering?

🔹useState holds state that, when changed, triggers re‐render of component.
🔹useRef holds a mutable ref object whose .current persists across renders, but changing it does not cause re-render.
🔹Useful for storing DOM references, timers, or values where you want mutability without causing re-render.
🔹Also useful to hold previous values (prev props/state) without triggering new render cycle
