I'll help you format and provide context for these interview topics using your preferred style. Let me first examine some of your existing files to understand your formatting style better.

Now I understand your formatting style! Let me format the interview topics from your notes with proper context and your preferred indentation and dash formatting:

```txt
Datadog vs Sentry
----
    -> Datadog: Full-stack observability platform for monitoring infrastructure, applications, and logs. Provides metrics, traces, and alerts for performance monitoring across entire tech stack.
    
    -> Sentry: Error tracking and performance monitoring focused on application-level issues. Specializes in catching exceptions, crashes, and performance bottlenecks in code.
    
    -> Key Difference: Datadog is broader (infrastructure + apps), Sentry is deeper (application errors + performance).

----------------

DB Caching
----
    -> Database caching stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and improve response times.
    
    -> Types:
        -> Query Result Caching: Cache query results (Redis, Memcached)
        -> Application-level Caching: Cache objects/data structures in app memory
        -> Database-level Caching: Built-in DB caches (MySQL query cache, PostgreSQL buffer cache)
    
    -> Strategies:
        -> Cache-aside: App manages cache, loads data on cache miss
        -> Write-through: Write to cache and DB simultaneously
        -> Write-behind: Write to cache first, DB later (async)

----------------

DB Replicas
----
    -> Database replication creates copies of data across multiple database instances for availability, performance, and disaster recovery.
    
    -> Types:
        -> Master-Slave: One write node (master), multiple read nodes (slaves)
        -> Master-Master: Multiple nodes can handle both reads and writes
        -> Read Replicas: Dedicated read-only copies to distribute read load
    
    -> Benefits: Load distribution, fault tolerance, geographic distribution, backup/recovery

----------------

Why ORMs vs Sequelize vs Others
----
    -> ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping): Map database tables to objects in code, abstract SQL queries.
    
    -> Sequelize: Popular Node.js ORM for SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
        -> Pros: Model definitions, migrations, validations, associations
        -> Cons: Performance overhead, learning curve, complex queries can be harder
    
    -> Alternatives:
        -> Prisma: Type-safe ORM with auto-generated client
        -> TypeORM: TypeScript-first ORM with decorators
        -> Knex.js: Query builder (not full ORM)
        -> Raw SQL: Direct database queries for maximum control

----------------

How JS Works in Browser vs Node.js
----
    -> Browser JavaScript:
        -> Runs in V8 (Chrome) or other JS engines
        -> Has DOM API, Web APIs (fetch, localStorage, etc.)
        -> Event loop handles UI events, network requests
        -> Sandboxed environment for security
    
    -> Node.js JavaScript:
        -> Runs on V8 engine outside browser
        -> Has file system, networking, process APIs
        -> Event loop handles I/O operations, timers
        -> Can access system resources directly
    
    -> Common: Same language syntax, event-driven, single-threaded with async I/O

----------------

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
----
    -> Planning: Requirements gathering, project scope definition
    -> Analysis: System requirements, feasibility study
    -> Design: Architecture, UI/UX design, database design
    -> Implementation: Coding, development
    -> Testing: Unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing
    -> Deployment: Production release, environment setup
    -> Maintenance: Bug fixes, updates, monitoring
    
    -> Methodologies: Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, DevOps

----------------

Why Choose Microservices?
----
    -> Scalability: Scale individual services based on demand
    -> Technology Diversity: Different services can use different tech stacks
    -> Team Independence: Teams can work on services independently
    -> Fault Isolation: Failure in one service doesn't bring down entire system
    -> Deployment Flexibility: Deploy services independently without affecting others
    
    -> Trade-offs: Increased complexity, network latency, data consistency challenges, monitoring overhead

----------------

NoSQL vs SQL
----
    -> SQL (Relational):
        -> Structured schema, tables with relationships
        -> ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
        -> Complex queries with JOINs
        -> Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle
    
    -> NoSQL (Non-relational):
        -> Flexible schema, document/key-value/graph/column-family
        -> BASE properties (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent)
        -> Horizontal scalability
        -> Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j
    
    -> Use SQL for: Complex transactions, reporting, structured data
    -> Use NoSQL for: Rapid development, unstructured data, high scalability

----------------

Repository Pattern
----
    -> Design pattern that acts as intermediary between business logic and data access layers
    -> Provides centralized, abstract interface for data operations (CRUD)
    -> Encapsulates data retrieval/storage logic, hiding database implementation details
    
    -> Benefits:
        -> Separation of concerns
        -> Improved testability (mock repositories)
        -> Code reusability
        -> Data source independence
        -> Centralized data access logic
    
    -> Implementation: Interface defines methods (get, save, delete), concrete class implements actual database operations
```

This formatting follows your style with:
- Main topics as headers with `----` underneath
- Indented bullet points using `->`
- Clear section separators with `----------------`
- Concise but comprehensive explanations
- Practical examples and comparisons
