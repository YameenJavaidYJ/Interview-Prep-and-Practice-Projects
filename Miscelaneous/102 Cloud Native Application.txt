Cloud-native applications are applications that are built to fully take advantage of cloud computing â€” meaning theyâ€™re designed from the ground up to be:

Scalable â€“ They can easily handle growth (like going from 100 users to 1 million) by adding more resources automatically.

Resilient â€“ If one part of the system fails, the whole app doesnâ€™t crash. It keeps running smoothly.

Flexible â€“ They can be updated, deployed, or rolled back quickly without downtime.

Portable â€“ They can run on different cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure) thanks to containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

ðŸ‘‰ How theyâ€™re built:

Usually developed with microservices architecture instead of one big monolithic app.

Packaged with containers (like Docker).

Managed and orchestrated using Kubernetes or similar tools.

Use cloud-managed services (databases, queues, caching, monitoring, etc.).

Examples of cloud-native apps:

Netflix (handles millions of streams reliably).

Uber (scales globally, handles spikes in rides).

Slack (real-time messaging with massive concurrency).

Given your experience with Docker, Kubernetes, GCP, and microservice-friendly frameworks like NestJS, youâ€™re already working in the cloud-native space.
