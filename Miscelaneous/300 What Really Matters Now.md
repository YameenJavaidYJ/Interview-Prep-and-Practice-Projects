Here’s what really matters now:

a) Problem-Solving and Algorithms

AI can generate code, but you need to know how to break down problems.

Practice LeetCode-style problems — not for syntax but for patterns:

Arrays, HashMaps, Graphs, Trees, DP (Dynamic Programming)

Time & space complexity trade-offs

Focus on explaining your reasoning step-by-step.

Example prompt they might test:

"Explain how you’d design a rate limiter system for an API and why you’d choose that approach."

b) System Design & Architecture

Especially for mid/senior roles:

Design REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, microservices

Understand:

Load balancing

Caching (Redis, CDN)

Database design (SQL vs NoSQL)

Event-driven systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

Be able to draw high-level architecture diagrams and discuss trade-offs.

c) Debugging and Code Reading

AI helps write code, but debugging is still a human skill.

Practice reading unfamiliar codebases.

Learn to trace through logic quickly.

Be comfortable with tools like:

Chrome DevTools

Postman / Insomnia

IDE Debuggers

d) Communication & Collaboration

AI can't replace good human collaboration:

Explaining your solution clearly.

Asking clarifying questions during interviews.

Working in pair programming settings.

e) AI-Augmented Development

Show that you can use AI effectively:

Prompt engineering basics for coding tools.

Knowing when not to trust AI-generated solutions.

Ability to integrate AI tools into your workflow (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT).

3. How to Prepare Practically

Mock interviews with platforms like Pramp, Interviewing.io, or with peers.
Build real projects and talk about them:

    Side projects using modern stacks (React + NestJS, FastAPI, etc.)
    Deploy them (Vercel, AWS, Railway)

Keep a portfolio of problems solved where you can explain your thought process.
Study behavioral questions too — soft skills are still key.

4. Types of Questions That Still Matter
    Type	                Example	Why it Matters
    Algorithms	            "Reverse a linked list"	Core reasoning
    System Design	        "Design a URL shortener"	High-level thinking
    Debugging	            "Find the bug in this API response"	Real-world troubleshooting
    Architecture Trade-offs	"SQL vs NoSQL for analytics?"	Decision-making
    Communication	        "Explain your last project to a non-tech person"	Collaboration

5. The Right Mindset
Instead of trying to outperform AI, focus on:
    Critical thinking
    Problem framing
    Real-world trade-offs
    Fast learning (AI is a tool, not a crutch)
