âš¡ Optimization

ðŸ‘‰ Making the current system run more efficiently.

Focus: Speed, efficiency, resource usage (CPU, memory, storage, etc.).

Works on the here and now â€” improving how well your system performs with its current workload.

Examples:

Reducing algorithm time complexity (O(nÂ²) â†’ O(n log n)).

Caching results to avoid redundant work.

Minifying JS/CSS files for faster web delivery.

Reusing database connections to reduce latency.

ðŸ“ˆ Scalability

ðŸ‘‰ The ability of a system to handle growth (more users, more data, more traffic) without breaking or slowing down.

    Focus: Capacity and adaptability.
    Works on the future â€” designing so the system can expand smoothly.

Examples:
    Adding more servers (horizontal scaling).
    Using load balancers to distribute traffic.
    Designing stateless APIs so they can scale out easily.
    Choosing a database that can handle sharding/replication.
