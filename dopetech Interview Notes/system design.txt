**Question:** Third party API allows 2000 requests/day, but user needs more than 2000. Solution?

**Answer:**

**Problem:** API rate limit: 2000 requests/day, user needs >2000

**Solution Architecture:**

1. **Request Processing**
   - we will be using a redis counter here that will count and reset daily
   - Lambda function forwards queue requests to 3rd party API
   - Ensures we stay within 2000/day limit

2. **Queue System**
   - SQS queue to buffer excess requests
   - Store user requests that exceed daily limit

3. **Error Handling**
   - Failed requests → back to SQS for retry
   - Ensures no request loss

4. **Scheduled Processing**
   - EventBridge triggers daily at midnight
   - Processes queued requests when new daily quota available
   - Checks queue → processes if not empty

**Key Benefits:**
- Respects API rate limits
- No request loss
- Scales beyond 2000 daily limit
- Automatic queuing & processing
