AI INTERVIEW QUESTION SUGGESTIONS
==================================

1. SYSTEM DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE
===============================

CQRS AND EVENT SOURCING
-----------------------
    -> Q: What is the difference between CQRS and Event Sourcing, and when would you use them?
    -> Context: Tests your knowledge of scalable architectures beyond simple CRUD

API GATEWAY VS BFF (BACKEND FOR FRONTEND)
-----------------------------------------
    -> Q: Why would you use a BFF layer with Next.js, and how does it differ from an API Gateway?
    -> Context: Evaluates understanding of frontend-backend interaction patterns in microservices

HORIZONTAL VS VERTICAL SCALING
------------------------------
    -> Q: How would you scale a high-traffic Next.js app differently at the frontend and backend layers?
    -> Context: Checks scalability awareness for both server-side rendering and APIs

2. DATABASES & DATA HANDLING
============================

ACID VS BASE TRADEOFFS
----------------------
    -> Q: Explain ACID vs BASE consistency models. When would you choose eventual consistency?
    -> Context: Many real systems (like microservices with replicas) rely on eventual consistency

SHARDING VS REPLICATION
-----------------------
    -> Q: What's the difference between database sharding and replication, and when would you use each?
    -> Context: Goes deeper than just replicas — tests distributed DB knowledge

QUERY OPTIMIZATION
------------------
    -> Q: How do you identify and fix a slow query in MongoDB or Postgres?
    -> Context: Evaluates practical debugging skills for production DB issues

3. BACKEND (NODE.JS + NESTJS FOCUS)
===================================

NESTJS DEPENDENCY INJECTION
---------------------------
    -> Q: Why does NestJS use dependency injection, and how does it help in building modular apps?
    -> Context: Core NestJS concept — tests if you understand its opinionated architecture

ASYNCHRONOUS HANDLING
---------------------
    -> Q: How does Node.js handle async operations internally, and why is the event loop important?
    -> Context: Goes beyond "callbacks vs promises" — shows deep Node.js understanding

AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION
------------------------------
    -> Q: How would you implement role-based access control (RBAC) in a NestJS + MongoDB app?
    -> Context: Security is a key full-stack responsibility

4. FRONTEND (REACT + NEXT.JS FOCUS)
===================================

NEXT.JS RENDERING MODES
-----------------------
    -> Q: Compare SSR, SSG, ISR, and CSR in Next.js. When would you choose one over another?
    -> Context: Shows if you understand trade-offs in performance and SEO

HYDRATION AND RECONCILIATION IN REACT
-------------------------------------
    -> Q: How does React hydration work in Next.js, and what problems can arise?
    -> Context: Evaluates deep frontend performance/debugging knowledge

STATE MANAGEMENT
---------------
    -> Q: When would you use Redux vs React Query vs Context API in a Next.js app?
    -> Context: Tests practical decision-making on handling global and async state

5. DEVOPS / MONITORING
======================

OBSERVABILITY STACK
-------------------
    -> Q: How would you set up monitoring for a microservice-based application (Datadog, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)?
    -> Context: Goes beyond coding — checks if you think about reliability

CI/CD PIPELINES
---------------
    -> Q: How would you design a CI/CD pipeline for a Next.js + NestJS monorepo?
    -> Context: Practical engineering workflow knowledge

6. GENERAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
===============================

DESIGN PATTERNS
---------------
    -> Q: Can you give an example of how you used the Strategy or Factory pattern in a recent project?
    -> Context: Tests abstract thinking and maintainability

TRADEOFFS IN MICROSERVICES
--------------------------
    -> Q: What are the biggest downsides of microservices, and how would you mitigate them?
    -> Context: Not just "why choose microservices" but whether you know the drawbacks (e.g., complexity, observability)

TESTING STRATEGY
----------------
    -> Q: What's your approach to testing in a full-stack MERN/Nest project (unit, integration, e2e)?
    -> Context: Reveals if you care about quality and not just coding

OTHER LIKELY FULL STACK INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (MERN/NEXT/NEST)
============================================================

    -> How would you structure a monorepo with Next.js frontend and NestJS backend?
    -> How do you handle caching in Next.js (getServerSideProps, API routes, edge caching)?
    -> How do you secure JWT authentication across microservices?
    -> How do you prevent N+1 query problems in MongoDB or GraphQL?
    -> How do you implement rate limiting in a Node.js/NestJS API?
    -> What's the difference between serverless deployment (Vercel, AWS Lambda) vs containerized (Docker + K8s)?
