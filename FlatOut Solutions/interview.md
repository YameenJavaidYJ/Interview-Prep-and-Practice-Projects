## Question 2: "Are you more a back-end person or front-end person? It's usually when we say full-stack, everybody has a back-end person."

### Suggested Answer:
> "I really believe I am balanced across the stack, but if I had to choose, I lean more towards backend architecture and API design.
> 
> I find the challenge of designing scalable systems, database optimization, and building robust APIs more fascinating.
> 
> However, I'm equally comfortable on the frontend"

## Question 3: "Tell me about a time when you thought you were right, and then you later on found out you were wrong, either yourself or somebody else pointed out that you were actually not right, and how did you handle that situation, and what was the end result?"

### Suggested Answer (STAR Format):

#### SITUATION:
> "I was working on a project implementing SAML authentication with Google Workspace. 
>
> We had a critical production issue where the server was crashing whenever users tried to login, preventing access to data."

#### TASK:
> "My task was to identify and fix the authentication system that was causing server crashes and restore user access to the application."

#### ACTION:
> "I initially thought the issue was in our authentication logic since we had handled all rbac cases recently. 
>
> After extensive log analysis, I discovered it was actually a clock skew issue - Google's SAML service tracks request timing, and our server time wasn't properly synchronized. 
>
> I implemented error handling in the SAML middleware to catch these third-party errors and respond appropriately instead of crashing the server."  

#### RESULT:
> "The server crashes stopped immediately,
> 
> I learned a crucial lesson about implementing proper error handling for external dependencies. 
>
> This experience made me much more careful about understanding all parameters and edge cases 
>
> before deployment, which has prevented similar issues in future projects."

> Saml Logs:
>  
> [ERROR] SAML assertion expired due to clock skew  
> [ERROR] Invalid timestamp in SAML response  
> [ERROR] SAML authentication failed - time synchronization issue

## Follow-up Question: "And how did you, how did, or when, can you tell me about the moment when you figured out that it wasn't that good of a decision?"

### Suggested Answer:
> "The moment of realization came when I saw the exact error message:  
'SAML assertion expired due to clock skew.'  
> 
> I had been debugging for about 2 hours, checking our authentication and RBAC logic,   
but the logs kept showing timestamp-related errors.  
> 
> In hindsight, those 2 hours deep in application code were a misstep—
I should have verified time synchronization earlier.  
> 
> That's when it hit me - I had been so focused on our application code that I completely overlooked the fundamental infrastructure issue.  
> 
> The moment was realizing that Google's SAML service was rejecting our requests not because of our code, but because our server's system clock was out of sync.

## Question 4: "What's the meaning of DevOps for you? Like, what does that mean? Is it a, you know, is it a team? Is it a person? What is DevOps for you? And how does it play a role in what you do?"

### Suggested Answer:
> "DevOps for me is more like a mindset, not a specific team or role.
>
> It's an environment where everyone takes ownership of the entire software delivery lifecycle.
>
> It's about taking responsibility for the entire system, not just my piece of it, and always looking for 
> ways to improve processes, reduce manual work, and increase reliability."
>
> 'How will this scale?' 'What happens when this fails?' and 'How can we make deployments safer and faster?
> 
> In my work, this means I won't just write code 
> 
> but think about how it will be deployed, monitored, and maintained in production from day one.

> Traditional: Dev writes → Ops runs → Dev fixes later. DevOps: Dev writes 
>
> Dev runs → Dev fixes now (on a platform built by Ops).

## How DevOps Breaks Down the Wall
### DevOps Philosophy:
    Shared Responsibility: Everyone owns the entire software delivery lifecycle
    Collaboration: Dev and Ops work together from day one
    Shared Tools: Same monitoring, same deployment processes
    Shared Goals: Fast delivery + reliable systems
### Why It's Called "DevOps"
    Not about eliminating roles, but about:
    Breaking silos between Dev and Ops
    Shared ownership of the entire process
    Collaborative culture instead of handoff culture
    Everyone thinking about both development AND operations

## The Traditional "Wall of Confusion"
### Before DevOps:
> Development Team: Writes code, tests locally, throws code "over the wall"
>
> Operations Team: Receives code, tries to deploy it, often fails
>
> Result: Blame game, delays, finger-pointing, "it works on my machine"

## Follow-up Question: "Okay, so what's, uh, what if there's no DevOps team or person, then what's, what's DevOps, then?"

### Suggested Answer:
> "Exactly! That's the beauty of DevOps - it doesn't require a dedicated team or person to exist.
> 
> When there's no DevOps team, DevOps becomes everyone's responsibility. Developers become more operationally aware, and operations becomes more development-focused like adapt IaC Practices.
> 
> In my experience, this actually works better because it creates a shared understanding and eliminates the 'us vs them' mentality.
> 
> Every developer should be thinking about how their code runs in production, how it's deployed, and how it's monitored.
> 
> Every team member should be asking 'How can we make this more reliable?' and 'What can we automate?'
> 
> DevOps without a dedicated team means everyone is a DevOps engineer in their own way - it's about mindset, practices, and collaboration, not job titles or organizational structure."

## Question 5: "How do you stay on top with new technological advancements or any new AI stuff? How do you stay on top of what's happening?"

### Suggested Answer:

> I subscribe to weekly newsletters/Blogs HackerNews or Medium or podCasts thePrimaGen or follow tech guys on linkedin.
> 
> When I encounter a new technology or approach that could solve a problem I've faced in my projects, 
> I research it thoroughly on how it should be implemented, 
>
> what problems it solves, and who would be best suited to lead the implementation.
> 
> This approach ensures I'm not just staying informed, but actively evaluating new technologies for real-world application and business value."

## Question 6: "Tell me about one thing you've learned recently. Could be you're on the On a technical side, or just anything you've learned recently, and how did you learn it, and how are you applying that thing that you learned?"

### Suggested Answer:
> Recently I learned about Domain Driven Design and ROP came from functional programming communities and practical examples in TypeScript.
> 
> What's fascinating about these concepts is how they solve real-world problems I've faced  
> DDD helps me model complex business domains more accurately, 
>
> ROP provides a clean way to handle error flows without nested try-catch blocks.
> 
> I'm using 
>
> DDD to model the domain properly and handle complex business rules  
>
> ROP to create clean, composable pipelines for data transformation and validation.
> 
> This has made the code much more maintainable and the business logic much clearer
>
> The error handling is now explicit and predictable, which is crucial for HIPAA compliance."

## Question 7: "Tell me about a time when you created a simple solution for a complex problem."

### Suggested Answer:
> "Emails getting ignored against event
> 
> -> The team was considering building a notification center, 
>
> implementing push notifications, SMS integration.
> 
> -> Instead, I suggested a much simpler approach - 
>
> -> we already had in-app notifications working perfectly, 
>
> -> I created a simple banner that appears whenever users log in, 
>
> showing any unread notifications with a clear 'Mark as Read' button.
> 
> -> Users started engaging with notifications at a 95% rate compared to the previous 30% email engagement.
> 
> -> Sometimes the best solution isn't the most complex one - 
>
> -> it's the one that addresses the root cause with minimal complexity and maximum impact."

---

## Question 8: "What's generally, so I'm sure you get tons of notifications, right, and in the team, we need to be notified about what other people do, so how do you deal with that flood of notification that comes at you every day, and how do you prioritize you, how do you make sure you spend enough time communicating with others, but also enough time on actually getting things done, and how do you do that, how do you plan your day when you start your day, do you start working, and then you look at what other people are doing later, or what? How do you manage your day? How do you plan your day? And how do you manage to keep on top of things and not get too distracted, but also distracted enough to not miss anything?"

### Suggested Answer:
> "I use a structured approach
> 
> I start each day with a 15-minute 'inbox zero' session where I quickly scan all notifications, categorize them by urgency, and respond to anything that needs immediate attention.
> 
> Then I block out 2-3 hour focused work sessions in the morning when I'm most productive, with notifications completely silenced except for critical alerts.
> 
> I schedule specific 'communication windows' - usually mid-morning and mid-afternoon - where I actively check team updates, respond to messages, and participate in discussions.
> 
> For notifications, accross diffrent channels 
> 
> WhatsApp gets immediate notifications only for critical issues (mute chats that annoy most), 
> 
> Slack gets batched notifications every hour for important updates, mute non essential channel
> 
> Email gets daily digests for informational updates.
> 
> This approach ensures I'm responsive to the team while maintaining deep focus time for complex problem-solving. The key is being intentional about when you're available versus when you're in deep work mode."

---

## Question 9: "Tell me about a time when you disagreed with either a more senior team member or with a client and how did that disagreement work?"

### Suggested Answer:
> "In our project, I disagreed with our senior architect about the notifications schema design. 
>
> He wanted to notification payload on run time using joins where as i preferred JSON
>
> We ended up compromising - we implemented the simpler schema after i presented him with a demo situation of 23 types of notification and fetch was compute heavy
> 
> This approach actually worked perfectly, and we never needed the complex schema. The key was focusing on the business problem rather than the technical elegance, and being willing to compromise while maintaining respectful disagreement."

---

## Question 10: "Tell me about a time when you had to work under pressure and you're either a production outage or something had to get done quickly and how do you work under pressure? What happens in your mind then?"

### Suggested Answer:
> "In our project we had a critical production outage where the database was completely overwhelmed, 
>
> causing the entire application to become unresponsive. 
> 
> Users couldn't access their health data, which was a HIPAA compliance nightmare.
> 
> When pressure hits, my mind actually becomes more focused and systematic. 
> 
> I took charge of the technical investigation.
> 
> I methodically went through our 
    > monitoring dashboards, 
    > checked database logs,
    > identified that we had an unoptimized query causing 1 million unnecessary write transactions every time a user performed an action.
> 
> The pressure actually helped me think more clearly - I realized we needed to optimize the query
>
> Within 2 hours, we had the fix deployed and the application was responsive again.

## Question 11: "What's your preferred tool stack, you know, like for planning and all of that or communication, like what do you currently use or what do you prefer?"

### Suggested Answer:
> "For project planning and task management, I prefer Jira combined with Confluence for documentation.
>
>  Sprint Progress / Bug Tracking 
>
> For communication, I use Slack for day-to-day team coordination and WhatsApp for urgent issues.
> 
> For development workflow, VS CODE.
