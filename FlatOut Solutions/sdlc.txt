-> Planning and Analysis: Gather business requirements with stakeholders; produce an SRS
    (Software Requirement Specification) and validate it with business.
-> Design: Translate SRS (Software Requirement Specification) into UX/UI and system architecture; 
    designers create pages; 
    developers define high‑level architecture and technical specs.
-> Development: Implement features and APIs; follow coding standards; commit via version control;
    integrate continuously.
-> Testing: Perform functional, integration, and regression tests to ensure a stable, bug‑free
    banking platform.
-> Deployment and Maintenance: Release to production, monitor, and iterate; apply the same
    process for new features and ongoing improvements.
