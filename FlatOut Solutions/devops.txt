### Cross-Functional Teams
- **Developer** (you)
- **QA Engineer**
- **Designer**
- **Product Manager**
- **DevOps/Operations person**
- All working together on the same project/feature

### Why Cross-Functional Teams Matter
**Benefits:**
- **Faster delivery** - no handoffs between teams
- **Better communication** - everyone understands the full picture
- **Shared responsibility** - everyone owns the outcome
- **Faster problem-solving** - different perspectives in one room
- **Reduced bottlenecks** - no waiting for other teams

### Maintainable
- Reduced code duplication
- Made updates easier (design components)
- Improved code readability
- Eliminated technical debt

### Cost-Effective
- Reduced infrastructure costs
- Optimized resource usage
- Improved performance
- Saved development time


DEVOPS LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW
==========================

WHAT IS DEVOPS?
===============
DevOps is a cultural and technical approach that bridges the gap between development
and operations teams. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous 
improvement throughout the software delivery lifecycle.

Key Principles:
- Collaboration between Dev and Ops teams
- Automation of manual processes
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Monitoring and observability
- Rapid feedback loops

DEVOPS LIFECYCLE COMPONENTS
===========================

1. DEVELOPMENT PHASE
2. BUILD & PACKAGE PHASE
3. TESTING PHASE
4. DEPLOYMENT PHASE
5. INFRASTRUCTURE PHASE
6. MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY

1. DEVELOPMENT PHASE
====================
-> Code Development
   - Developers write code using version control (Git)
   - Code reviews and collaboration through GitHub
   - Feature branches and pull request workflows

-> Version Control
   - Git for source code management
   - GitHub for collaboration and code reviews
   - Branching strategies (GitFlow, GitHub Flow)

2. BUILD & PACKAGE PHASE
========================
-> Continuous Integration (CI)
   - Automated builds triggered by code commits
   - Running tests and quality checks
   - Code analysis and security scanning

-> Containerization
   - Docker for packaging applications
   - Container images for consistent deployments
   - Multi-stage builds for optimization

3. TESTING PHASE
================
-> Automated Testing
   - Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests
   - Test automation in CI/CD pipeline
   - Quality gates and test coverage

-> Security Testing
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency checks
   - Security compliance validation

4. DEPLOYMENT PHASE
===================
-> Container Registry
   - GCR (Google Container Registry) for storing Docker images
   - Image versioning and tagging
   - Security scanning of container images

-> Orchestration
   - GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) for container orchestration
   - Pod management and scaling
   - Service mesh and networking

5. INFRASTRUCTURE PHASE
========================
-> Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
   - Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
   - Version-controlled infrastructure
   - Consistent environments (dev, staging, prod)

-> Cloud Computing
   - GCP (Google Cloud Platform) as the cloud provider
   - GCE (Google Compute Engine) for virtual machines
   - Auto-scaling and load balancing

6. MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
=============================
-> Application Monitoring
   - Google Cloud Monitoring for metrics
   - Logging with Google Cloud Logging
   - Tracing and performance monitoring

-> Infrastructure Monitoring
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Cost monitoring and optimization
   - Alerting and incident response

7. FEEDBACK & IMPROVEMENT
=========================
-> Continuous Feedback
   - User feedback collection
   - Performance metrics analysis
   - Error tracking and resolution

-> Process Improvement
   - Retrospectives and lessons learned
   - Process optimization
   - Tool and technology updates

GCP SERVICES USAGE IN LIFECYCLE
================================

GCP (Google Cloud Platform) - Overall Platform
-> Used in: ALL phases
-> Purpose: Provides the cloud infrastructure and services

GCE (Google Compute Engine) - Virtual Machines
-> Used in: Infrastructure Phase
-> Purpose: Hosts applications, databases, and legacy systems
-> Example: Running VMs for non-containerized applications

GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) - Container Orchestration
-> Used in: Deployment Phase
-> Purpose: Manages containerized applications
-> Example: Running microservices, auto-scaling pods

GCR (Google Container Registry) - Docker Image Storage
-> Used in: Build & Package Phase, Deployment Phase
-> Purpose: Stores and manages Docker container images
-> Example: Storing application images built by CI/CD pipeline

GCS (Google Cloud Storage) - Object Storage
-> Used in: All phases (data storage, backups, artifacts)
-> Purpose: Stores files, backups, logs, and static assets
-> Example: Storing application logs, user uploads, backup files

DEVOPS TOOLS COMPARISON
========================

GitHub Actions vs Pipeline:
- GitHub Actions: Integrated with GitHub, easier setup, good for smaller teams
- Pipeline: More flexible, better for complex workflows, enterprise features

GCP Services:
- GCP: Google Cloud Platform (overall cloud provider)
- GCE: Google Compute Engine (virtual machines)
- GKE: Google Kubernetes Engine (container orchestration)
- GCR: Google Container Registry (Docker image storage)
- GCS: Google Cloud Storage (object storage)

BENEFITS OF DEVOPS
==================
- Faster time to market
- Improved collaboration
- Higher quality software
- Reduced deployment risks
- Better resource utilization
- Continuous improvement culture

DEVOPS BEST PRACTICES
=====================
- Automate everything possible
- Monitor and measure everything
- Implement security from the start
- Use Infrastructure as Code
- Practice continuous integration
