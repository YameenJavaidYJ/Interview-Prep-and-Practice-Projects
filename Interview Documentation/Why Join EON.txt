I’m excited about this role because 

-> it lets me deepen my healthcare experience beyond claims and appointments, into impactful patient management systems. 
-> At Carbonteq I saw the need for more cross-team collaboration, and I value how EON fosters that culture of 
    knowledge sharing. 
-> I also see the opportunity at EON to grow myself in AI-driven solutions and infrastructure, so I can deliver true 
    end-to-end systems. 
-> Beyond that, the idea of identifying risks early and actually saving patients fascinates me, and 
-> EON’s mission of making healthcare affordable and life-saving really resonates with me.

-> Over time I realized my current company’s way of working was becoming less aligned with my values — especially 
    around cross-team collaboration. 
-> I’m looking for an environment like EON where teams learn from each other and work more closely together.
